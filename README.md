# Sportitor Advanced Pitch Deck

This repository contains the advanced, interactive pitch deck for **Sportitor**, a fictional but comprehensively structured sports technology platform. This presentation is designed as a high-fidelity, single-page application built entirely within one React component to maximize portability and demonstration impact.

It is crafted to be highly engaging, responsive, and visually dynamic, targeting potential investors and key stakeholders.

## ‚ú® Features

This pitch deck is more than a static document; it's an interactive application with the following key features:

- **Single-Component Architecture:** The entire application (structure, logic, and styling) is contained within the App.jsx file, making deployment and review straightforward.  
- **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout, navigation, and content adapt seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS utility classes.  
- **Dynamic Scrolling:** Includes a scroll progress indicator and a smooth "Scroll to Top" button for enhanced navigation.  
- **Interactive Navigation:** A sticky header with a responsive mobile menu to jump between key sections (Problem, Solution, Market, Financials, etc.).  
- **Dynamic Visuals:** Subtle background particle effects and an interactive aura effect follow the cursor (mousePosition state), adding a modern, high-tech feel.  
- **Integrated Audio:** The component includes logic for background audio playback and control, enhancing the immersive presentation experience (audio data is in base64 format for self-containment).  
- **Modern React Hooks:** Utilizes useState, useEffect, and useRef for managing UI state, side effects, and direct DOM interactions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **React:** Frontend library for building the user interface.  
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework used for fast, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing styling.  
- **Lucide React:** A collection of beautiful, high-quality open-source icons used throughout the presentation.  
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core logic and interactivity.
